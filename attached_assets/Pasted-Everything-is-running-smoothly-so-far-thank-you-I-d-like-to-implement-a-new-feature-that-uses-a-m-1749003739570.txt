Everything is running smoothly so far â€” thank you! I'd like to implement a new feature that uses a machine learning model to help predict the top 50 stocks to buy each day based on expected short-term return. Here's a step-by-step breakdown:

ðŸ†• Feature: "Top 50 Stocks to Buy Today" â€” Powered by ML
ðŸŽ¯ Goal:
Automatically predict and display the top 50 stocks with the highest expected return for the next 1â€“5 days.

Use an ML model trained on historical market data to generate daily predictions.

Automatically update results once per day.

ðŸ”§ Feature Workflow (Step-by-Step):
âœ… 1. Fetch Daily Stock Data
Use yfinance, alpaca, or another stock API to collect OHLCV (Open, High, Low, Close, Volume) data for ~500 popular tickers (e.g., S&P 500)

Fetch the past 30â€“90 days of data for each stock

python
Copy
Edit
import yfinance as yf

tickers = ['AAPL', 'MSFT', 'GOOGL', ...]
data = {ticker: yf.download(ticker, period='60d', interval='1d') for ticker in tickers}
âœ… 2. Feature Engineering
For each stock, compute technical indicators such as:

Moving averages (MA5, MA10, MA20)

Relative Strength Index (RSI)

Bollinger Bands

Momentum

Create a feature vector for each day

Example:

python
Copy
Edit
def make_features(df):
    df['MA5'] = df['Close'].rolling(window=5).mean()
    df['RSI'] = compute_rsi(df['Close'])  # your custom RSI function
    df['Momentum'] = df['Close'].diff()
    return df.dropna()
âœ… 3. Train a Machine Learning Model
Use a supervised learning model like:

RandomForestRegressor or GradientBoostingRegressor

Label each sample with the future return (e.g., next 3-day return) as the target variable

Train on historical stock data

python
Copy
Edit
from sklearn.ensemble import RandomForestRegressor

model = RandomForestRegressor()
model.fit(X_train, y_train)  # Features and target: next N-day return
âœ… 4. Daily Prediction
Every day, generate the current feature vector for each stock

Use the ML model to predict the expected return

Sort by predicted return and select Top 50

python
Copy
Edit
predictions = {}
for ticker in tickers:
    X_today = make_features(data[ticker]).iloc[-1].values.reshape(1, -1)
    y_pred = model.predict(X_today)[0]
    predictions[ticker] = y_pred

top_50 = sorted(predictions.items(), key=lambda x: x[1], reverse=True)[:50]
âœ… 5. Display Results
Add a UI panel or console output to show:

Ticker symbol

Predicted return (e.g., +4.2%)

Optional: mini price trend chart or sector info

ðŸ“ˆ Top 50 Stocks to Buy Today (ML-Driven)
----------------------------------------
1. NVDA â†’ +5.2%
2. AAPL â†’ +4.9%
3. AMZN â†’ +4.7%
...
âœ… 6. Schedule Daily Update
Use schedule or time.sleep() for time-based logic

Or deploy on Replit Always-On Repl to run once per day

ðŸ“¦ Optional (Future Upgrades)
Add model retraining logic every X days using new data

Create model evaluation dashboard (accuracy, win rate, avg return)

Let user choose between indicator-based or ML-based suggestions

Iâ€™d love help integrating this ML-powered prediction pipeline. Let me know if I should prep the dataset, build the model logic, or provide examples. Happy to work on it collaboratively!

Thanks again!
