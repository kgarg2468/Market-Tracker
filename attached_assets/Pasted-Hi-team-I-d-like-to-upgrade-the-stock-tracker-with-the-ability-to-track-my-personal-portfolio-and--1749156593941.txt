Hi team,

I’d like to upgrade the stock tracker with the ability to track my personal portfolio and get timely sell alerts based on past recommendations. Here's what I’m looking for:

🧾 1. Portfolio Tracker
Option A: Connect to TradingView

If possible, use TradingView’s API (or webhook integration) to read my active positions

If not available or restricted, skip to Option B

Option B: Manual Portfolio Input

Create a portfolio.json file or in-app interface where I can input:

json
Copy
Edit
[
  {
    "ticker": "AAPL",
    "buy_price": 172.50,
    "buy_date": "2025-06-01",
    "shares": 10
  },
  ...
]
🧠 2. Sell Signal Logic
For each recommended stock that I bought, the app should automatically track and give me sell signals using one of these methods:

✅ Option 1: ML-based Price Target
After recommending a buy, the model assigns a predicted return (e.g. +6% in 5 days)

If:

Target return is hit (e.g. +6% reached), OR

Time expires (e.g. 5 days pass)
→ Trigger a sell recommendation

✅ Option 2: Trailing Stop / Loss Limit
Sell if:

The stock drops more than X% from peak (e.g. -5%)

OR it gains >X% but starts to fall (protect gains)

✅ Option 3: Technical Signal
Example: Sell when price drops below 20-day moving average

📤 3. Daily Portfolio Status Output
Add a console output (or UI card) like:

vbnet

📊 Portfolio Summary (as of 2025-06-04)
---------------------------------------
AAPL: +4.3% since 06/01 (Hold - target not reached)
NVDA: +7.0% since 05/30 (SELL - target met)
TSLA: -6.5% since 05/29 (SELL - stop loss)
⏱️ 4. Daily Update + Alert Logic
Runs daily alongside stock scanning

Compares current price with:

Buy price

Target prediction

Stop loss or time expiry

Alerts me with "SELL" or "HOLD" for each stock

Let me know if you need help generating dummy data or defining thresholds. Thanks!

👨‍🏫 Side Note: How Long Should I Hold a Recommended Stock?
That depends on your model and goal. Common strategies:

Strategy	Hold Duration	Sell When...
Swing Trading (Short)	2–10 days	Target % return hit, or time is up
Momentum	As long as it climbs	Breaks trendline or falls below key moving avg
Fundamental/Value	Weeks–months	Price reaches fair value, bad earnings
ML-based Forecast	Based on prediction horizon (e.g. 5-day return forecast)	

A practical rule: Set a price target + time stop for every trade, and stick to it unless major news changes.
