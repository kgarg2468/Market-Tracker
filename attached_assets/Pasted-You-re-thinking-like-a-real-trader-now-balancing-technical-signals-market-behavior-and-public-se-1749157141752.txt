You’re thinking like a real trader now — balancing technical signals, market behavior, and public sentiment. Let's level up your Replit app with a descriptive message to integrate:

📩 New Feature Request for Replit: Sentiment-Aware Trading Suggestions
Subject: Upgrade Trading Bot with Sentiment & Controversy Analysis

Hi team,

The trading bot is doing well with numeric-based predictions, but after a bad experience with Tesla (where it advised buying due to a +2% potential but the stock dropped ~$40 the next day), I want to add two important layers of complexity to prevent such misjudgments:

🧠 1. Predicting Future Recovery or Further Decline
Add a Machine Learning model or logic that does the following when a stock tanks after a "BUY" suggestion:

Analyze post-drop behavior:

Is this dip a normal pullback or start of a downward trend?

Pull in:

Historical rebound patterns

Volume spikes

RSI (Relative Strength Index): Is it oversold (<30)?

Support levels: Is it near a long-term support price?

Output:

A recommendation: "Likely Recovery", "Likely Continued Drop", or "Uncertain"

This affects the SELL/HOLD recommendation

🔥 2. Add Real-World Controversy and Sentiment Signals
Many bad trades happen not because of numbers, but because of news and public sentiment (e.g., Elon Musk’s controversial tweets).

Add logic to track news and social sentiment:

Use APIs or news scraping (free options include NewsAPI, Google News RSS, or Twitter/X if accessible)

Look for keywords in recent headlines:

Controversy: "boycott", "CEO statement", "probe", "SEC", "fraud", "lawsuit"

Positive: "record revenue", "AI partnership", "approval"

Assign a sentiment score to each stock, for example:

Edit
{
  "TSLA": {
    "sentiment": -0.75,
    "risk_keywords": ["boycott", "politics", "Musk tweet"],
    "confidence": "Low"
  }
}
➕ Extra:
Track Reddit + Twitter mentions if possible

Stocks with high controversy or negative public view should:

Not be recommended

Or be flagged with: "⚠️ High Risk: Public sentiment declining"

📤 3. Updated Output Example

📊 Recommendation Summary: June 3, 2025

TSLA: 📉 Down -6.8% since buy signal (172 → 132)
→ Sentiment: 🔴 Negative (Controversial CEO remarks, boycott trending)
→ RSI: 23 (Oversold)
→ Prediction: High volatility, uncertain short-term rebound
→ ⚠️ SELL or HOLD with caution

MSFT: 🟢 Buy Signal
→ Sentiment: Positive (AI announcement, strong earnings)
→ Confidence: High
→ Predicted return: +4.1% in 3 days
⏳ Optional Future Upgrade
Train an LSTM or Prophet model to:

Predict next-day or next-5-day movement after dips

Compare sentiment and price momentum together

Let me know if you'd like help writing a basic Python script for real-time sentiment scoring using NewsAPI or Google News search. Also happy to build an oversold-recovery ML model using Tesla's historical data.

Thanks again
