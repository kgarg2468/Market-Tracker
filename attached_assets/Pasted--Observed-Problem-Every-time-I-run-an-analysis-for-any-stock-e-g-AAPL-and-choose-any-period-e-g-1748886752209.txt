 Observed Problem
Every time I run an analysis for any stock (e.g., AAPL) and choose any period (e.g., 60 days), the dashboard returns the warning:

pgsql

Edit
Limited data available for [STOCK]. Only [N] days of data found. Some indicators may be less reliable.
Example: For AAPL with a 60-day analysis period, it says:
"Only 41 days of data found," even though AAPL clearly has decades of historical data.

‚ùå Root Cause (Suspected)
yfinance.download() default interval: The data may be downloaded using an incorrect interval (e.g., "1m" or "1d" with limited period instead of start/end dates), which restricts how far back it goes.

Incorrect use of period vs start/end: If you pass only period=60, yfinance may interpret it as 60 calendar days or use a restricted API format, often leading to fewer rows than expected.

Missing error handling for holidays or weekends: Stock markets are not open every calendar day, so requesting 60 calendar days doesn‚Äôt yield 60 rows.

‚úÖ Step-by-Step Fix Instructions
üß© Step 1: Fix the Data Download Function
Open utils/data_loader.py or wherever yfinance.download() is used.
Change the function to explicitly use start and end dates rather than just a "period".

python
Copy
Edit
from datetime import datetime, timedelta
import yfinance as yf

def get_data(ticker, days=60):
    end = datetime.today()
    start = end - timedelta(days=days * 2)  # Extend range to account for weekends/holidays
    df = yf.download(ticker, start=start.strftime('%Y-%m-%d'), end=end.strftime('%Y-%m-%d'), interval="1d")
    df.dropna(inplace=True)
    return df.tail(days)  # Trim to exact number of trading days
üß© Step 2: Update the Warning Logic
In the section where the warning message is shown, update the logic:

python
Copy
Edit
if len(df) < requested_days:
    warning = f"Only {len(df)} days of valid trading data found. Some indicators may be less reliable."
else:
    warning = None
üß© Step 3: Test With Known Tickers
Use reliable tickers with long histories (e.g., AAPL, MSFT, SPY) and test for:

30 days

60 days

100 days

Confirm that enough data is returned, and that the warning only shows when real trading days are missing.

üö´ Bonus Bug: ta.volume.VolumeSMAIndicator Missing
You're also using an invalid indicator in ta.volume:

Error analyzing AAPL: module 'ta.volume' has no attribute 'VolumeSMAIndicator'
Fix: This class doesn't exist in ta (as of the latest version). Either remove it or use an alternative like:

python

df['volume_sma_20'] = df['Volume'].rolling(window=20).mean()
